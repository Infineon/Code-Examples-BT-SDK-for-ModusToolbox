# Code-Examples-BT-20819A1-1.0-for-ModusToolbox

## Overview

These examples demonstrate the functionality of the CYW920819 device. Apps in the 'demo' folder are reference applications and more complex in nature. Apps in the 'snips' folder demonstrate a specific feature or library. These examples support ModusToolbox v1.1. They do not work with ModusToolbox v1.0. 

Each example has a readme.txt that explains what do and what to observe when running the example. Also review the 20819_readme.txt for an overvivew of the BT-20819A1 SDK features and tools. 

Supported kits for the CYW920819 device are CYW920819EVB-02 (http://www.cypress.com/CYW920819EVB-02) and CYBT-213043-MESH (http://www.cypress.com/CYBT-213043-MESH).

Additional PSoC 6-related code examples that leverage connectivity are available in other repos. See all examples at [Code Examples for Modus Toolbox](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Code-Examples-for-ModusToolbox-Software).

You can browse the code examples in the repository, or use GitHub's search capabilities to find a particular symbol or term. Type the term into the search box at the top of this page and search in this repository.

## Adding the Code Example to the IDE

Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine. You can also clone the repository into a location on your local machine. This puts all the code examples on your local machine.

In the ModusToolbox IDE, click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File > New > ModusToolbox IDE Application**). Pick your kit (or a custom board). You must use a kit or device supported by the code example.

In the **Starter Application** window, click the **Import** button and navigate to the *modus.mk* file for the example. Click **Next** and complete the application creation process.

## BT-20819A1 Code Examples

The  *CYBT-213043-MESH/apps* folder contains demos and snips set up for the CYBT-213403-MESH platform. The same mesh examples exist in the CYW920819EVB-02 folder, for that platform. 

The *CYW920819EVB-02/apps* folder contains additional examples. Use the examples in the CYW920819EVB-02 folder if you have that platform.
